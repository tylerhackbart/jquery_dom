<!-- // EXERCISE: The Book List

// Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

// Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
// Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
// Copy the array of books from the previous exercise.
// Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
// Bonus: Use a ul and li to display the books.
// Bonus: add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an img element for each book on the page.
// Bonus: Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
